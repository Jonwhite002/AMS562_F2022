# How to Run & Test

## Building/Compiling
To compile the program, first move into the folder directory. Then type ```g++ main.cpp array.cpp```, and finally ```./a``` to execute.

## Testing

Most of the functions behave as they were expected to by the professor, but some additional documentation will be provided.

### Constructors

```Array()```, initializes both ```_size``` and ```_data``` to zero.
